# Simple Todo App

A sleek and responsive task management application built to help users organize their daily activities with ease. This project was developed to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage — fundamental skills in front-end development.

## Functionality

This application allows users to:
	•	Add new tasks
	•	Mark tasks as complete
	•	Delete individual tasks
	•	Persist tasks across browser sessions using localStorage
	•	Get a clear visual indication of completed vs. pending items

Designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, the interface makes managing to-dos quick and efficient.

## Technology

	•	HTML5 – Semantic structure and layout
	•	CSS3 – Custom styling with responsive design principles
	•	JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – For dynamic behavior and DOM interaction
	•	LocalStorage – To persist user tasks without a backend
 
## Deployment

The app is live and accessible via GitHub Pages:
